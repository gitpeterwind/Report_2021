\section{Updates in Emission Systems}
\label{sec:updateEmis}

\subsection{New model basis for emission sectors: GNFR\_CAMS}
\label{ssec:gnfr}

%\COMMENT{Text/Table from gmdPaper}
 
Gridded anthropogenic emissions from CEIP
were previously categorized into 11
SNAP sectors, but for many years now EMEP emission reporting has been conducted and prepared for
modelling using the 13-sector
GNFR system\footnote{
GNFR=Gridding nomenclature for reporting/UNECE nomenclature for reporting of emissions to air,
e.g. \citealt{CEIP2020:GNFR}}.
In 2020 a 19-sector emission system (`GNFR\_CAMS') was implemented in the EMEP model, to take care of
emissions provided by TNO as part of the Copernicus CAMS project \citep{GranierCAMS2019,Kuenen2021}. This extended emissions system
enables for example four road traffic sectors, F1--F4, with e.g. F1
 representing exhaust emissions from gasoline vehicles.
Such emission sectors are characterised in the model by
release heights, timefactors and species-splits (e.g. NOx to NO and
\ce{NO2}, or NMVOC to individual VOC surrogates) for each sector, with each
characteristic defined by a mapping index. 

It should be noted that this 19-sector system is designed as a practical super-set of likely emission sectors present in emission files, and the  user is free to use GNFR, SNAP or other inventories when running the model. The user-guide gives more details about the usage of different emission options, use of the mapping indices, and the potential to define own emission sectors.
Table~\ref{tab:GNFRsectors} summarises the new GNFR\_CAMS sectors,
and the mapping indices used.

\subsection{Soil NO emissions}
\label{ssec:soilNO}

The EMEP model now makes uses of a new global dataset for soil NO
emissions. This dataset, described in detail in \citet{SimpsonDarras:2021},
provides gridded monthly data and the corresponding 3-hourly
weight factors at \ResEq{0.5} degrees horizontal resolution, over
the period 2000-2018.  The basic methodology merges methods from
\citet{YiengerLevy:1995}, with various updates to reflect recent
literature \citep[especially][]{SteinkampLawrence2011}, and some
simplifications which reflect lack of  availability of some key data.

The CAMS-GLOB-SOIL v2.2 NOx inventory
provides estimate of soil NO emissions from four categories:

\begin{description}
  \item[Biome] - a background emission rate for each landcover type, modified by temperature
and soil moisture % (CRF?)
  \item[Fert] - emissions resulting from applied fertilizer and manure inputs to soils. (We assume
that  0.7\% of the N-inputs are re-emitted as NO.)
  \item[Ndep] - emissions resulting from atmospheric N deposition (also 0.7\%)
  \item[Pulsing] - emissions resulting from rain and/or soil moisture changes after
    a dry period
\end{description}

In developing CAMS-GLOB-SOIL , we  expressed the total soil emission fluxes as the sum
of these terms:

\begin{equation}
  \Fs = \Fb  + \Ff + \Fd + \Fp
  \label{eqn:Fs}
\end{equation}


Where \Fn then is the sum of the \Fb, \Fd, and \Fp terms, and where the
flux terms have units \ngN. The calculations of \Fb, \Ff, \Fd and \Fp
are detailed in \citet{SimpsonDarras:2021}.
Figure~\ref{fig:SIemis} illustrates the contribution of these terms for
the European region. 
%Given that some anthropogenic inventories seem to include emissions from fertilized %agricultural areas similar to our \Ff, \citet{SimpsonDarras:2021} introduced \Fn, %such that:
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \Fs = \Fn  + \Ff
%  \label{eqn:Fn}
%\end{equation}

     for Europe.
    \label{fig:SIemis}}
  }
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Risk of double-counting?}

An important issue arose during the construction  of this inventory - the risk of double-counting
soil-NO emissions, since some anthropogenic  emission inventories include and 
some exclude emissions from agricultural soils.
Indeed, within the LRTAP Convention,
most countries mainly report NOx emissions due to agricultural activities
using the EMEP/EEA Emissions Inventory Guidebook
\citep{Guidebook2019:3D}. The Guidebook provides methods for calculating
soil-NO data from fertilizer and other inputs.
\citet{SimpsonDarras:2021} present the main sources for which
 soil NO emissions areas covered by the Guidebook, and
compare the nationally
submitted emissions following this system with the CAMS estimates.
It is shown that for the vast majority of countries
the main emission categories are NFR  3Da1,3Da2a-c,and
3Da3, which together are roughly equivalent to
the `Fert' emissions from CAMS-GLOB-SOIL.

When using EMEP emissions derived from
officially reported data (with soil NO emissions as given in GNFR L),
for example in EMEP MSC-W reporting runs,
\citet{SimpsonDarras:2021} recommended to retain the
official GNFR L data, but but add biome, N-dep and pulse emissions from CAMS-GLOB-SOIL.

\citet{SimpsonDarras:2021} also give recommendations for
ECLIPSE v5 and v6 inventories, and for CAMS-GLOB and CAMS-REG. In
some cases the CAMS-GLOB-SOIL \Nfert emissions should be used, but
in other cases not. In the EMEP model this choice is governed
by the config\_emep.nml variable \verb|USES%SOILNOX_METHOD|, which can
be set to either `Total', or `NoFert'. 


%\COMMENT{SKIP:Will add some words on impact of new soil emissions later.}

\subsection{DMS emissions}
\label{ssec:DMS}

\COMMENT{Michael: can you convert equations to math style, and use equation environment to get numbering. Thanks.}

A new option to calculate biogenic emissions of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) has been added to the EMEP model. It is based on the climatology of sea surface DMS concentrations published by \citet{Lana2011} and the meteorological data driving the EMEP model, and it has been used for this year's status run. 

At each location and timestep, the model calculates the Schmidt number ($Sc$) from the sea surface temperature ($SST$, given in \textdegree C) with the 4th-degree formula of \citet{Wanninkhof2014}:


\begin{equation}
Sc=2855.7 -177.63\  SST + 6.0438\  SST^2 - 0.11645\  SST^3 + 0.00094743\ SST^4
\end{equation}


The transfer velocity $K_{w}$ (given in cm hour$^{-1}$) is then calculated  from the Schmidt number and the 10-meter wind speed $u_{10}$ (given in m~s$^{-1}$) with the formula of \citet{Nightingale2000}:

\begin{equation}
K_w=(0.222\  u_{10}^2 +0.333\ u_{10}) \sqrt{\frac{600}{Sc}}
\end{equation}

Following \citet{Leonor:DMS2} we assume that 66\% of the DMS in air is converted into \ce{SO2}. The DMS emission is thus implemented in the model as an \ce{SO2} flux as:

\begin{equation}
F_{\ce{SO2}} = 0.66\ O_{\textrm{DMS}}\ (K_{w}\ 0.01/3600)\ g\ \rho\ A\ / p  
\end{equation}

where $O_{\textrm{DMS}}$ is the surface water DMS concentration (in nanomol L$^{-1}$),
$g$ is standard gravity (9.807 m s$^{-2}$),
$\rho$ is the ambient density of air (kg m$^{-3}$),
$p$ is ambient air pressure,
and A is Avogadro's number (6.023e+23 mol$^{-1}$).

The options to calculate the Schmidt number and transfer velocity, and also to use the older climatology of \citet{Kettle1999}, are still available in the EMEP model.

\subsection{Aircraft emissions}
\label{ssec:Aircraft}

 LTO (landing/take-off) emission data are, as before, taken from CEIP, i.e. based on aircraft emissions officially reported by countries for up to 3000 feet above the surface. However, the high distribution in the EMEP model has been slightly revised. We assume that, in approximation, half of the LTO emissions (from CEIP) occur below 50 meters above the surface, while the other half is evenly distributed over the height range between 50 meters and about 3000 feet.
 Furthermore, aircraft emissions at higher altitudes than 3000 feet are now based on a new dataset (CAMS-GLOB-AIR, \citealt{GranierCAMS2019}), given separately for all years from 2000 to 2019, with monthly variation and a spatial resolution of 0.5$^\circ$\,$\times$\,0.5$^\circ$\,$\times$\,610\,m. This dataset has been provided through the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and can be downloaded from the Atmosphere Data Store of ECMWF (\url{https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/}).

In the EMEP model, CAMS-GLOB-AIR emissions between 0 and 610m (2000 ft) above the surface are not used, and half of the CAMS-GLOB-AIR emissions between 610 and 1220m are evenly distributed over the model layers corresponding to that height range. The assumption behind this approach is that emissions up to 3000 feet should already be fully included in the CEIP (LTO) emissions. Above 1220m (4000ft), CAMS-GLOB-AIR emissions are used in full, and interpolated to the relevant model grid during model runtime.

The option of using the old QUANTIFY data (\url{www.pa.op.dlr.de/quantify}) instead of CAMS-GLOB-AIR for non-LTO emissions is still available in the EMEP model.

\subsection{Revised fine/coarse splits of sea-salt emissions}
\label{ssec:updateSS}

The split of sea salt between the fine and coarse fractions have been revised based on the results of comparison of modelled \chem{Na+} in \PM[2.5] and \PM[10] with EMEP observations. Namely, the fraction of sea salt emitted in \PM[2.5] fraction has been slightly increased (while the total sea salt emissions in \PM[10] remain unchanged). 

More specifically, sea salt is emitted in seven size bins up to 10~\um in diameter, from which the smallest four bins were previously assigned to the \PM[2.5] fraction and the remaining three bins comprised coarse sea salt. Now, the fifth bin is split 50/50 \% between the \PM[2.5] and \PM[2.5-10] fractions.  


This modification has a minor effect on formation of coarse \ce{NO3-} as the surface area of coarse sea salt has slightly decreased.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Emission speciation and `rnr' splits}
\label{ssec:emissplits}

The emissions speciation of primary PM (PPM) were updated
to reflect recent data available from
ECLIPSE v6b dataset
(\url{https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/air/ECLIPSEv6.html}).
These emissions were provided for the years 2000-2016 (plus 2020 and some future
scenarios), and give country-specific fine and coarse emissions of EC, OM and remaining
PPM (remPPM) in fine and coarse modes.

In many previous studies we have distinguished estimated wood-burning and
fossil-fuel emissions, but for the runs presented in this report we
have made the simpler distinction between GNFR category C (mainly
residential emissions), and other GNFR sectors.  We denote this
split the `rnr' (residential-non-residential) split, and have slightly
modified the EmChem19a chemical mechanism to cope with the addition
of `remPPM' from GNFR C.

\subsection{Monthly timefactors for global modelling.}
\label{ssec:monthlyFacs}

New country-based monthly timefactors were produced for countries outside of Europe. These factors were derived by making country-average factors from global gridded SNAP-based data from the ECLIPSE v6b dataset. ECLIPSE factors only created for "robust" sectors (SNAP-1, 2, 3, 4, and 10), since other sectors showed either no monthly variation (e.g. traffic), or very sporadic events that are not expected to be representative for all years (e.g. shipping, or waste-burning). For SNAP-10 (agr) the NH3 data are from ECLIPSE `agr\_NH3', otherwise from `agr'.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Revised PBL parametrisations}
\label{sec:updateKz}

The new default calculation of eddy diffusivity coefficient \textit{Kz} (`TROENKz') follows the method described in \citet{troenkz}. Unlike the old \textit{Kz} method (JericevicKz) which does not consider the stability within the boundary layer, this new \textit{Kz} method differentiates \textit{Kz} formulation in the stable and unstable boundary layer conditions. Therefore, the new method performs reasonably well in cases of weak surface heat flux and transitions between stable and unstable cases \citep{troenkz}. However, we have not seen significant changes in modelled concentrations. The formulation of \textit{Kz} is given as below. In the unstable boundary layer:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_h = (1 - 16 \times \min(z, z_\mathit{surf}) \times \frac{1}{L})^{-\frac 1 2}
\end{equation}
while in the stable boundary layer:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_h = 1 + 5 \times z \times \frac{1}{L}
\end{equation}
with \textit{Kz} given as: 
\begin{equation}
    \mathit{Kz} = 0.4 \times \frac{u_*}{\phi_h} \times z \times (1 - \frac z h)^2
\end{equation}
in which $z$ is the height from surface, $h$ is boundary layer depth, $z_\mathit{surf}$ is the height of surface layer which is assumed to be 10\% of the boundary layer depth $h$,  $L$ is the Monin-bukhov length \citep{Garratt}, and $u_*$ is friction velocity.

The default calculation of PBL is updated to the HmixMethod JcRb\_t2m. Compared with the old HmixMethod JcRb, the new one uses temperature at 2 m instead of temperature at the middle of the lowest grid cell to formulate PBL in the stable conditions. For unstable conditions, the new formulation is the same as the JcRb method. The differences in concentrations are unnoticeable between the two methods, but this update is more accurate according to the original reference paper \citep{JcRb}.  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Local Fractions}
\label{sec:updateLF}

The Local Fractions method \citep{wind-2020} is a framework that allows the tracking of thousands of sources in a single run at a low computational cost. It is fully implemented for primary particles, but also reduced nitrogen compounds can be treated. The tracking of other species is less accurate, but progress is being made to eventually include a correct description for all species.

Since last year, the range of applications of the Local Fractions has been extended.
The sources can be defined by either a list of countries or group of countries, as small squares surrounding the receptor grid (with user defined range and square sizes), or as regions defined as "masks" given in a NetCDF file.
Wet and dry deposition (separately) per source country can now also be computed.

  }
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Other}
\label{sec:updateOther}

A number of smaller changes have been made:

\begin{description}

  \item[IAM\_CROP] A new generic crop type has been introduced for integrated assessment modelling outputs. This is an updated version of the previously used IAM\_CR species \citep{Simpson:EMEP2012}, in which the phenology factor (\fphen) has been set to 1.0 across the ozone flux accumulation period. The IAM\_CR parameters gave a reduction in \fphen towards the end of the period, and hence lower POD than the new category gives (c.f.Fig~\ref{fig:PODcomp}).
  
    \item[fracPM25] A fraction of coarse nitrate particulate mass has been allocated to the \PM[2.5] fraction in order to represent the fact that some of the particles from the coarse fraction have aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5~\um. The value of this fraction was previously 27\% \citep{Simpson:EMEP2012}. In the latest version this fraction was reduced to 13\%, in order to better account for the differences between mass-median and aerodynamic diameters.
  
  \item[Pollen emissions] Although the effect of pollen on \PM[2.5] concentrations is negligible, it is an important allergen. Therefore, it has been included as part of the model forecast capabilities. Optional birch, olive, ragweed and grass pollen emissions based on \citet{Sofiev-2015,Sofiev-2017} were included in version rv4.34, and later expanded to include alder and mugwort pollen emissions. 
  
  \item[Timezones] A global map of time-zones was produced to enable more accurate calculations for global-scale modelling. The new system also estimates summer and winter times where appropriate. (The previous system used simple longitude methods to estimate local time, and had no accounting for summer/winter time.) 
  
  \item[Shipping emissions] Shipping emissions now spread as 20\% below 20m, 80\% between 20-90m. 
  
    \item[RH limits] RH limits (giving maximum values) were added to the Gerber-calculations of aerosol size: 99\% for rural aerosol, and 99.99\% for sea-salt, following \citet{Gerber1985}. This change prevents excessive buildup of surface area in certain conditions.
    
  \item[RH-2m] NWP model rh2m now used in place of earlier sub-grid calculation. This simplification was made since temperature and heat flux data also had no sub-grid calculation. % 9/2
