                   of the weakest aspects of weather and climate
                   modeling today, and the explicit simulation of clouds
                   will be one of the next major achievements in
                   numerical weather prediction. Research cloud models
                   have been in development over the last 45 years and
                   they continue to be an important tool for
                   investigating clouds, cloud-systems, and other
                   small-scale atmospheric dynamics. The latest
                   generation are now being used for weather prediction.
                   The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model, representative
                   of this generation and of a class of models using
                   explicit time-splitting integration techniques to
                   efficiently integrate the Euler equations, is
                   described in this paper. It is the first fully
                   compressible conservative-form nonhydrostatic
                   atmospheric model suitable for both research and
                   weather prediction applications. Results are
                   presented demonstrating its ability to resolve
                   strongly nonlinear small-scale phenomena, clouds, and
                   cloud systems. Kinetic energy spectra and other
                   statistics show that the model is simulating small
                   scales in numerical weather prediction applications,
                   while necessarily removing energy at the gridscale
                   but minimizing artificial dissipation at the resolved
                   scales. Filtering requirements for atmospheric models
                   and filters used in the ARW model are discussed. (c)

  abstract =      {Environmental policies in Europe have successfully
                   eliminated the most visible and immediate harmful
                   effects of air pollution in the last decades.
                   However, there is ample and robust scientific
                   evidence that even at present rates Europe's
                   emissions to the atmosphere pose a significant threat
                   to human health, ecosystems and the global climate,
                   though in a less visible and immediate way. As many
                   of the low hanging fruits' have been harvested by
                   now, further action will place higher demands on
                   economic resources, especially at a time when
                   resources are strained by an economic crisis. In
                   addition, interactions and interdependencies of the
                   various measures could even lead to
                   counter-productive outcomes of strategies if they are
                   ignored. Integrated assessment models, such as the
                   GAINS (Greenhouse gas Air pollution Interactions and
                   Synergies) model, have been developed to identify
                   portfolios of measures that improve air quality and
                   reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least cost. Such
                   models bring together scientific knowledge and
                   quality-controlled data on future socio-economic
                   driving forces of emissions, on the technical and
                   economic features of the available emission control
                   options, on the chemical transformation and
                   dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere, and the
                   resulting impacts on human health and the
                   environment. The GAINS model and its predecessor have
                   been used to inform the key negotiations on air
                   pollution control agreements in Europe during the
                   last two decades. This paper describes the
                   methodological approach of the GAINS model and its
                   components. It presents a recent policy analysis that
                   explores the likely future development of emissions
                   and air quality in Europe in the absence of further
                   policy measures, and assesses the potential and costs
                   for further environmental improvements. To inform the
                   forthcoming negotiations on the revision of the
                   Gothenburg Protocol of the Convention on Long-range
                   Transboundary Air Pollution, the paper discusses the
                   implications of alternative formulations of
                   environmental policy targets on a cost-effective
                   allocation of further mitigation measures. (C) 2011

                   AFstY indices for assessing the ozone-induced risk to

                   concentration and stomatal flux, respectively, above
                   a threshold value. The robustness is expressed as the
                   sensitivity to changes in inputs and the uncertainty
                   due to input errors. The input data are taken from a
                   regional-scale chemical transport model. Both indices
                   show increasing sensitivity with increasing threshold
                   values. The sensitivity depends on the threshold and
                   the characteristics of the frequency distribution for
                   concentrations and stomatal fluxes. AFstY appears
                   less sensitive than AOTX for the thresholds adopted
                   for critical levels. The couplings between
                   concentration gradients and deposition algorithms
                   complicate the assessment of the total uncertainty.
                   For AFstY, the uncertainty due to the modelled
                   stomatal conductance may sometimes increase, but
                   sometimes decrease, the overall uncertainty
                   significantly. In particular, the maximum stomatal
                   conductance plays an important role in determining

                   the causes of differences in the EC measured using
                   different thermal evolution protocols; thereby the
                   major positive and negative biases affecting
                   thermal-optical analysis have been isolated and
                   minimised to define an optimised protocol suitable
                   for European aerosols. Our approach to improve the
                   accuracy of the discrimination between OC and EC was
                   essentially based on four goals. Firstly, charring
                   corrections rely on faulty assumptions – e.g.
                   pyrolytic carbon is considered to evolve completely
                   before native EC throughout the analysis –, thus we
                   have reduced pyrolysis to a minimum by favoring
                   volatilisation of OC. Secondly, we have minimised the
                   potential negative bias in EC determination due to
                   early evolution of light absorbing carbon species at
                   higher temperatures in the He-mode, including both
                   native EC and combinations of native EC and pyrolytic
                   carbon potentially with different specific
                   attenuation cross section values. Thirdly, we have
                   minimised the potential positive bias in EC
                   determination resulting from the incomplete evolution
                   of OC during the He-mode which then evolves during
                   the He/O2-mode, potentially after the split point.
                   Finally, we have minimised the uncertainty due to the
                   position of the OC/EC split point on the FID response
                   profile by introducing multiple desorption steps in
                   the He/O2-mode. Based on different types of
                   carbonaceous PM encountered across Europe, we have
                   defined an optimised thermal evolution protocol, the
                   EUSAAR_2 protocol, as follows: step 1 in He, 200 °C
                   for 120 s; step 2 in He 300 °C for 150 s; step 3 in
                   He 450 °C for 180 s; step 4 in He 650 °C for 180 s.
                   For steps 1–4 in He/O2, the conditions are 500 °C
                   for 120 s, 550 °C for 120 s, 700 ° C for 70 s, and
                   850 °C for 80 s, respectively.},

  abstract =      {European scale harmonized monitoring of atmospheric
                   composition was initiated in the early 1970s, and the
                   activity has generated a comprehensive dataset
                   (available at http://www.emep.int) which allows the
                   evaluation of regional and spatial trends of air
                   pollution during a period of nearly 40 yr. Results
                   from the monitoring made within EMEP, the European
                   Monitoring and Evaluation Programme, show large
                   reductions in ambient concentrations and deposition
                   of sulphur species during the last decades.
                   Reductions are in the order of 70–90\% since the
                   year 1980, and correspond well with reported emission
                   changes. Also reduction in emissions of nitrogen
                   oxides (NOx) are reflected in the measurements, with
                   an average decrease of nitrogen dioxide and nitrate
                   in precipitation by about 23\% and 25\% respectively
                   since 1990. Only minor reductions are however seen
                   since the late 1990s. The concentrations of total
                   nitrate in air have decreased on average only by 8\%
                   since 1990, and fewer sites show a significant trend.
                   A majority of the EMEP sites show a decreasing trend
                   in reduced nitrogen both in air and precipitation on
                   the order of 25\% since 1990. Deposition of base
                   cations has decreased during the past 30 yr, and the
                   pH in precipitation has increased across Europe.
                   Large inter annual variations in the particulate
                   matter mass concentrations reflect meteorological
                   variability, but still there is a relatively clear
                   overall decrease at several sites during the last
                   decade. With few observations going back to the
                   1990s, the observed chemical composition is applied
                   to document a change in particulate matter (PM) mass
                   even since 1980. These data indicate an overall
                   reduction of about 5 μg m−3 from sulphate alone.
                   Despite the significant reductions in sulphur
                   emissions, sulphate still remains one of the single
                   most important compounds contributing to regional
                   scale aerosol mass concentration. Long-term ozone
                   trends at EMEP sites show a mixed pattern. The
                   year-to-year variability in ozone due to varying
                   meteorological conditions is substantial, making it
                   hard to separate the trends caused by emission change
                   from other effects. For the Nordic countries the data
                   indicate a reduced occurrence of very low
                   concentrations. The most pronounced change in the
                   frequency distribution is seen at sites in the UK and
                   the Netherlands, showing a reduction in the higher
                   values. Smaller changes are seen in Germany, while in
                   Switzerland and Austria, no change is seen in the
                   frequency distribution of ozone. The lack of
                   long-term data series is a major obstacle for
                   studying trends in volatile organic compounds (VOC).
                   The scatter in the data is large, and significant
                   changes are only found for certain components and
                   stations. Concentrations of the heavy metals lead and
                   cadmium have decreased in both air and precipitation
                   during the last 20 yr, with reductions in the order
                   of 80–90\% for Pb and 64–84\% for Cd
                   (precipitation and air respectively). The
                   measurements of total gaseous mercury indicate a
                   dramatic decrease in concentrations during 1980 to
                   about 1993. Trends in hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs)
                   show a significant decrease in annual average air
                   concentrations. For other persistent organic
                   pollutants (POPs) the patterns is mixed, and differs
                   between sites and between measurements in air versus
                   precipitation.},

                   NO,emissions using 6-hour general circulation model
                   forcing. New features of this source relative to the
                   latest published ones by Dignon et al. {[}1992] and
                   Muller {[}1999] include synoptic-scale modeling of
                   `'pulsing'' (the emissions burst following the
                   wetting of a dry soil), a biome dependent scheme to
                   estimate canopy recapture of NO, and an explicit
                   linear dependence of emission on N fertilizer rate
                   for agricultural soils. Our best estimate for annual
                   above-canopy emissions is 5.5 Tg N (NO,) with a range
                   of 3.3-7.7 Tg N. Globally, the strongest emitters are
                   agriculture, grasslands, and tropical rain forests,
                   accounting for 41\%, 35\%, and 16\% of the annual
                   budget, respectively. `'Pulsing'' contributes 1.3 Tg
                   N annually. In temperate regions, agriculture
                   dominates emission, and in tropical regions,
                   grassland dominates. Canopy recapture is significant,
                   consuming, on average, possibly 50\% of soil
                   emissions. In temperate regions, periodic temperature
                   changes associated with synoptic-scale disturbances
                   can cause emission fluctuations of up to 20 ng N
                   m(-2) s(-1), indicating a close a correlation between
                   emission and warm weather events favorable to

                   trace gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) in determining the
                   Earth's radiation budget makes it necessary to
                   accurately reproduce seawater DMS distribution and
                   quantify its global flux across the sea/air
                   interface. Following a threefold increase of data
                   (from 15,000 to over 47,000) in the global surface
                   ocean DMS database over the last decade, new global
                   monthly climatologies of surface ocean DMS
                   concentration and sea-to-air emission flux are
                   presented as updates of those constructed 10 years
                   ago. Interpolation/extrapolation techniques were
                   applied to project the discrete concentration data
                   onto a first guess field based on Longhurst's
                   biogeographic provinces. Further objective analysis
                   allowed us to obtain the final monthly maps. The new
                   climatology projects DMS concentrations typically in
                   the range of 1-7 nM, with higher levels occurring in
                   the high latitudes, and with a general trend toward
                   increasing concentration in summer. The increased
                   size and distribution of the observations in the DMS
                   database have produced in the new climatology
                   substantially lower DMS concentrations in the polar
                   latitudes and generally higher DMS concentrations in
                   regions that were severely undersampled 10 years ago,
                   such as the southern Indian Ocean. Using the new DMS
                   concentration climatology in conjunction with
                   state-of-the-art parameterizations for the sea/air
                   gas transfer velocity and climatological wind fields,
                   we estimate that 28.1 (17.6-34.4) Tg of sulfur are
                   transferred from the oceans into the atmosphere
                   annually in the form of DMS. This represents a global
                   emission increase of 17\% with respect to the
                   equivalent calculation using the previous
                   climatology. This new DMS climatology represents a
                   valuable tool for atmospheric chemistry, climate, and
                   Earth System models.}},

                   reported from two deliberate tracer experiments in
                   the southern North Sea during February 1992 and 1993.
                   A conservative tracer, spores of the bacterium
                   Bacillus globigii var. Niger, was used for the first
                   time in an in situ air-sea gas exchange experiment.
                   This nonvolatile tracer is used to correct for
                   dispersive dilution of the volatile tracers and
                   allows three estimations of the transfer velocity for
                   the same time period. The first estimation of the
                   power dependence of gas transfer on molecular
                   diffusivity in the marine environment is reported.
                   This allows the impact of bubbles on estimates of the
                   transfer velocity derived from changes in the
                   helium/sulphur hexafluoride ratio to be assessed.
                   Data from earlier dual tracer experiments are
                   reinterpreted, and findings suggest that results from
                   all dual tracer experiments are mutually consistent.
                   The complete data set is used to test published
                   parameterizations of gas transfer with wind speed. A
                   gas exchange relationship that shows a dependence on
                   wind speed intermediate between those of Liss and
                   Merlivat {[}1986] and Wanninkhof {[}1992] is found to
                   be optimal. The dual tracer data are shown to be
                   reasonably consistent with global estimates of gas
                   exchange based on the uptake of natural and
                   bomb-derived radiocarbon. The degree of scatter in
                   the data when plotted against wind speed suggests
                   that parameters not scaling with wind speed are also
                   influencing gas exchange rates.}},

  abstract =      {Abstract Increasing both crop productivity and the
                   tolerance of crops to abiotic and biotic stresses is
                   a major challenge for global food security in our
                   rapidly changing climate. For the first time, we show
                   how the spatial variation and severity of
                   tropospheric ozone effects on yield compare with
                   effects of other stresses on a global scale, and
                   discuss mitigating actions against the negative
                   effects of ozone. We show that the sensitivity to
                   ozone declines in the order soybean > wheat > maize >
                   rice, with genotypic variation in response being most
                   pronounced for soybean and rice. Based on stomatal
                   uptake, we estimate that ozone (mean of 2010–2012)
                   reduces global yield annually by 12.4\%, 7.1\%, 4.4\%
                   and 6.1\% for soybean, wheat, rice and maize,
                   respectively (the “ozone yield gaps”), adding up
                   to 227 Tg of lost yield. Our modelling shows that the
                   highest ozone-induced production losses for soybean
                   are in North and South America whilst for wheat they
                   are in India and China, for rice in parts of India,
                   Bangladesh, China and Indonesia, and for maize in
                   China and the United States. Crucially, we also show
                   that the same areas are often also at risk of high
                   losses from pests and diseases, heat stress and to a
                   lesser extent aridity and nutrient stress. In a
                   solution-focussed analysis of these results, we
                   provide a crop ideotype with tolerance of multiple
                   stresses (including ozone) and describe how ozone
                   effects could be included in crop breeding
                   programmes. We also discuss altered crop management
                   approaches that could be applied to reduce ozone
                   impacts in the shorter term. Given the severity of
                   ozone effects on staple food crops in areas of the
                   world that are also challenged by other stresses, we
                   recommend increased attention to the benefits that
                   could be gained from addressing the ozone yield gap.},

                   vegetation have been compiled for Europe for the
                   years 1990–2006. Sources include scientific papers,
                   conference proceedings, reports to research funders,
                   records of confirmed ozone injury symptoms and an
                   international biomonitoring experiment coordinated by
                   the ICP Vegetation. The latter involved
                   ozone-sensitive (NC-S) and ozone-resistant (NC-R)
                   biotypes of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) grown
                   according to a common protocol and monitored for
                   ozone injury and biomass differences in 17 European
                   countries, from 1998 to 2006. Effects were separated
                   into visible injury or growth/yield reduction. Of the
                   644 records of visible injury, 39% were for crops (27
                   species), 38.1% were for (semi-)natural vegetation
                   (95 species) and 22.9% were for shrubs (49 species).
                   Due to inconsistencies in reporting effort from year
                   to year it was not possible to determine geographical
                   or temporal trends in the data. Nevertheless, this
                   study has shown effects in ambient air in 18 European
                   countries from Sweden in the north to Greece in the
                   south. These effects data were superimposed on AOT40
                   (accumulated ozone concentrations over 40 ppb) and
                   POD3gen (modelled accumulated stomatal flux over a
                   threshold of 3 nmol m−2 s−1) maps generated by
                   the EMEP Eulerian model (50 km×50 km grid) that were
                   parameterised for a generic crop based on wheat and
                   NC-S/NC-R white clover. Many effects were found in
                   areas where the AOT40 (crops) was below the critical
                   level of 3 ppm h. In contrast, the majority of
                   effects were detected in grid squares where POD3gen
                   (crops) were in the mid-high range (>12 mmol m−2).
                   Overall, maps based on POD3gen provided better fit to
                   the effects data than those based on AOT40, with the
                   POD3gen model for clover fitting the clover effects
                   data better than that for a generic crop.},

                   conducted under naturally fluctuating environmental
                   conditions in 2-4 countries, resulting in linear
                   dose-response relationships with response variables
                   specific to each receptor (r2 = 0.49-0.87, p < 0.001
                   for all). For crops, critical levels were derived for
                   effects on wheat (grain yield, grain mass, and
                   protein yield), potato (tuber yield) and tomato

                   whole tree biomass for beech and birch, and Norway

                   level for effects on productive and high conservation
                   value perennial grasslands was based on effects on
                   important component species of the genus Trifolium
                   (clover species). These critical levels can be used
                   to assess protection against the damaging effects of
                   ozone on food security, important ecosystem services
                   provided by forest trees (roundwood production, C

                   Convention on the Long Range Transport of Air
                   Pollution, LTRAP), have brought together various
                   regional air quality models to analyze their
                   performance in terms of air concentrations and wet
                   deposition, as well as to address other specific
                   objectives. This paper jointly examines the results
                   from both project communities by intercomparing and
                   evaluating the deposition estimates of reduced and
                   oxidized nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) in Europe
                   simulated by 14 air quality model systems for the
                   year 2010. An accurate estimate of deposition is key
                   to an accurate simulation of atmospheric
                   concentrations. In addition, deposition fluxes are
                   increasingly being used to estimate ecological
                   impacts. It is therefore important to know by how
                   much model results differ and how well they agree
                   with observed values, at least when comparison with
                   observations is possible, such as in the case of wet
                   deposition. This study reveals a large variability
                   between the wet deposition estimates of the models,
                   with some performing acceptably (according to
                   previously defined criteria) and others
                   underestimating wet deposition rates. For dry
                   deposition, there are also considerable differences
                   between the model estimates. An ensemble of the
                   models with the best performance for N wet deposition
                   was made and used to explore the implications of N
                   deposition in the conservation of protected European
                   habitats. Exceedances of empirical critical loads
                   were calculated for the most common habitats at a
                   resolution of 100 x 100m(2) within the Natura 2000
                   network, and the habitats with the largest areas
                   showing exceedances are determined. Moreover,
                   simulations with reduced emissions in selected source
                   areas indicated a fairly linear relationship between
                   reductions in emissions and changes in the deposition
                   rates of N and S. An approximate 20\% reduction in N
                   and S deposition in Europe is found when emissions at
                   a global scale are reduced by the same amount.
                   European emissions are by far the main contributor to
                   deposition in Europe, whereas the reduction in
                   deposition due to a decrease in emissions in North
                   America is very small and confined to the western
                   part of the domain. Reductions in European emissions
                   led to substantial decreases in the protected habitat
                   areas with critical load exceedances (halving the
                   exceeded area for certain habitats), whereas no
                   change was found, on average, when reducing North
                   American emissions in terms of average values per
                   habitat.}},

  abstract =      {Ecosystems and the atmosphere: This review describes
                   the state of understanding the processes involved in
                   the exchange of trace gases and aerosols between the
                   earth's surface and the atmosphere. The gases covered
                   include NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, NH3, SO2, DMS, Biogenic
                   VOC, O3, CH4, N2O and particles in the size range 1
                   nm-10 [mu]m including organic and inorganic chemical
                   species. The main focus of the review is on the
                   exchange between terrestrial ecosystems, both managed
                   and natural and the atmosphere, although some new
                   developments in ocean-atmosphere exchange are
                   included. The material presented is biased towards
                   the last decade, but includes earlier work, where
                   more recent developments are limited or absent. New
                   methodologies and instrumentation have enabled, if
                   not driven technical advances in measurement. These
                   developments have advanced the process understanding
                   and upscaling of fluxes, especially for particles,
                   VOC and NH3. Examples of these applications include
                   mass spectrometric methods, such as Aerosol Mass
                   Spectrometry (AMS) adapted for field measurement of
                   atmosphere-surface fluxes using micrometeorological
                   methods for chemically resolved aerosols. Also
                   briefly described are some advances in theory and
                   techniques in micrometeorology. For some of the
                   compounds there have been paradigm shifts in approach
                   and application of both techniques and assessment.
                   These include flux measurements over marine surfaces
                   and urban areas using micrometeorological methods and
                   the up-scaling of flux measurements using aircraft
                   and satellite remote sensing. The application of a
                   flux-based approach in assessment of O3 effects on
                   vegetation at regional scales is an important policy
                   linked development secured through improved
                   quantification of fluxes. The coupling of monitoring,
                   modelling and intensive flux measurement at a
                   continental scale within the NitroEurope network
                   represents a quantum development in the application
                   of research teams to address the underpinning science
                   of reactive nitrogen in the cycling between
                   ecosystems and the atmosphere in Europe. Some
                   important developments of the science have been
                   applied to assist in addressing policy questions,
                   which have been the main driver of the research
                   agenda, while other developments in understanding
                   have not been applied to their wider field especially
                   in chemistry-transport models through deficiencies in
                   obtaining appropriate data to enable application or
                   inertia within the modelling community. The paper
                   identifies applications, gaps and research questions
                   that have remained intractable at least since 2000
                   within the specialized sections of the paper, and
                   where possible these have been focussed on research
                   questions for the coming decade.},
