journal={Nature Energy},

month={Aug},

volume={4},
number={8},
pages={657-663},
abstract={China is the largest worldwide consumer of solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity, with 130{\thinspace}GW of installed capacity as of 2017. China's PV capacity is expected to reach at least 400{\thinspace}GW by 2030, to provide 10{\%} of its primary energy. However, anthropogenic aerosol emissions and changes in cloud cover affect solar radiation in China. Here, we use observational radiation data from 119 stations across China to show that the PV potential decreased on average by 11--15{\%} between 1960 and 2015. The relationship between observed surface radiation and emissions of sulfur dioxide and black carbon suggests that strict air pollution control measures, combined with reduced fossil fuel consumption, would allow surface radiation to increase. We find that reverting back to 1960s radiation levels in China could yield a 12--13{\%} increase in electricity generation, equivalent to an additional 14{\thinspace}TWh produced with 2016 PV capacities, and 51--74{\thinspace}TWh with the expected 2030 capacities. The corresponding economic benefits could amount to US{\$}1.9{\thinspace}billion in 2016 and US{\$}4.6--6.7{\thinspace}billion in 2030.},

abstract = {Global aerosol optical thicknesses and radiative properties need to be known for the study of decadal temperature change. Aerosol distributions have been developed from global transport models for a mixture of sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel burning, including also contributions from other major aerosol types such as soil dust and sea salt. Between the years 1950 and 1990 the aerosol distributions change due to changes in emissions of SO2 and carbon particles from fossil fuel burning. The optical thickness of fossil fuel derived aerosols increased by nearly a factor of 3 during this period, with particularly strong increase in eastern Asia. In countries where environmental laws came into effect since the early 1980s (e.g., United States and western Europe), emissions and consequently aerosol optical thicknesses did not increase considerably after 1980, resulting in a shift in the global distribution pattern. In addition to the optical thickness, aerosol single scattering albedos may have changed during this period due to different trends in absorbing black carbon and reflecting sulfate aerosols. However, due to uncertainties in the emission trends, which are especially large in the case of carbonaceous aerosols, such change cannot be determined with any confidence. Radiative forcing of this aerosol distribution is calculated for several scenarios. Uncertainties in the contribution of the strongly absorbing black carbon aerosol leads to a range in top-of-atmosphere forcings of ≈ −0.5 to +0.1 Wm−2.},

abstract = {Abstract There is high uncertainty in the direct radiative forcing of black carbon (BC), an aerosol that strongly absorbs solar radiation. The observation-constrained estimate, which is several times larger than the bottom-up estimate, is influenced by the spatial representativeness error due to the mesoscale inhomogeneity of the aerosol fields and the relatively low resolution of global chemistry-transport models. Here we evaluated the spatial representativeness error for two widely used observational networks (AErosol RObotic NETwork and Global Atmosphere Watch) by downscaling the geospatial grid in a global model of BC aerosol absorption optical depth to 0.1° × 0.1°. Comparing the models at a spatial resolution of 2° × 2° with BC aerosol absorption at AErosol RObotic NETwork sites (which are commonly located near emission hot spots) tends to cause a global spatial representativeness error of 30\%, as a positive bias for the current top-down estimate of global BC direct radiative forcing. By contrast, the global spatial representativeness error will be 7\% for the Global Atmosphere Watch network, because the sites are located in such a way that there are almost an equal number of sites with positive or negative representativeness error.},

abstract = "This paper synthesizes data on aerosol (particulate matter, PM) physical and chemical characteristics, which were obtained over the past decade in aerosol research and monitoring activities at more than 60 natural background, rural, near-city, urban, and kerbside sites across Europe. The data include simultaneously measured PM10 and/or PM2.5 mass on the one hand, and aerosol particle number concentrations or PM chemistry on the other hand. The aerosol data presented in our previous works (Van Dingenen et al., 2004, Putaud et al., 2004) were updated and merged to those collected in the framework of the EU supported European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical action COST633 (Particulate matter: Properties related to health effects). A number of conclusions from our previous studies were confirmed. There is no single ratio between PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations valid for all sites, although fairly constant ratios ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 are observed at most individual sites. There is no general correlation between PM mass and particle number concentrations, although particle number concentrations increase with PM2.5 levels at most sites. The main constituents of both PM10 and PM2.5 are generally organic matter, sulfate and nitrate. Mineral dust can also be a major constituent of PM10 at kerbside sites and in Southern Europe. There is a clear decreasing gradient in SO42− and NO3− contribution to PM10 when moving from rural to urban to kerbside sites. In contrast, the total carbon/PM10 ratio increases from rural to kerbside sites. Some new conclusions were also drawn from this work: the ratio between ultrafine particle and total particle number concentration decreases with PM2.5 concentration at all sites but one, and significant gradients in PM chemistry are observed when moving from Northwestern, to Southern to Central Europe. Compiling an even larger number of data sets would have further increased the significance of our conclusions, but collecting all the aerosol data sets obtained also through research projects remains a tedious task."

Examining the spatial and temporal variability of CM is important for understanding its sources and transport, evaluating its environmental impacts, and designing mitigation strategies. CM was computed at 195 collocated U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PM10 and PM2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) sites from 2000 through 2016. These data were integrated with remote/rural CM data at 155 sites from the IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) network to create a continental-scale dataset of daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual mean CM concentrations, as well as regionally aggregated data. Annual mean average continental United States (CONUS) urban CM concentrations were twice that of rural CM concentrations (10.5 μg m−3 versus 4.9 μg m−3, respectively) for 2012–2016. The highest CM concentrations occurred in the Southwest in spring, the central United States in summer and fall, and southern California nearly year-round. The lowest CM concentrations occurred in the Intermountain West, northwestern United States, and regions in the East. While urban CM concentrations were higher, CONUS average urban and rural CM/PM10 fractions were similar, with an annual mean fraction of 0.5. However, many regions, especially across the West, experienced much higher fractions (>0.7) depending on season. Regional mean CM weekly cycles with lower weekend concentrations were observed at both urban and rural sites throughout most of the country, indicating anthropogenic influence. Trend analyses suggest spring and summer mean CM has increased significantly at some remote and urban sites over the 2000–2016 period, especially at sites in the central and eastern United States. However, CONUS annual mean urban CM has decreased significantly (p < 0.05) at a rate of −1.8\% yr−1 compared to an insignificant increase of 0.5\% yr−1 at rural sites. Urban and rural relative contributions of CM to PM10 have increased since 2000 due to the strong reductions of PM2.5 mass. Understanding CM seasonal and temporal variability, composition, and sources is increasingly important in order to develop effective mitigation strategies for managing its environmental and climate impacts."

For the 1927 and 1559 daily coincident measurements that were obtained for c051 and c061, respectively, MODIS AOT varied by 86 and 90\%, respectively, within the predicted uncertainty of one standard deviation of the retrieval over land (ΔAOT = ±0.05 ± 0.15·AOT). For the coastal AERONET site Gustav Dalen Tower (GDT), Sweden, larger deviations were found for MODIS c051 and c061 (79\% and 75\%, respectively, within predicted uncertainty). The Baltic Sea provides substantially better statistical representation of AOT than the surrounding land areas and therefore favours the investigations of trends in AOT over the region. Negative trends of 1.5\% and 1.2\% per year in AOT, based on daily averaging, were found for the southwestern Baltic Sea from MODIS c051 and c061, respectively. This is in line with a decrease of 1.2\% per year in AOT at the AERONET station Hamburg. For the western Gotland Basin area, Sweden, negative trends of 1.5\%, 1.1\% and 1.6\% per year in AOT have been found for MODIS c051, MODIS c061 and AERONET GDT, respectively. The strongest trend of –1.8\% per year in AOT was found for AERONET Belsk, Poland, which can be compared to –1.5\% per day obtained from MODIS c051 over central Poland. The trends in MODIS and AERONET AOT are nearly all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. The strongest aerosol sources are suggested to be located southwest, south and southeast of the investigation area, although the highest prevalence of pollution events is associated with air mass transport from southwest. }

We used AOD data products from MODIS, MISR and AERONET and emission estimates from the EMEP, REAS and IPCC inventories. The trends in global monthly AOD of MODIS (L3), MISR (L3) and AERONET (L2) are significantly negative over Europe and North America, whereas over South and East Asia they are mostly positive. The calculated 2000–2009 trends from the monthly L3 products correspond well with the more detailed daily MODIS L2 AODs for three selected regions (Central Mediterranean, North-East America and East Asia). Furthermore, daily and monthly AERONET L2 AOD trends agree well. The trends in AOD are compared to estimated emission changes of SO2, NOx, NH3 and black carbon. We associate the downward trends in AOD over Europe and North America with decreasing emissions of SO2, NOx and other pollutants. Over East Asia the MODIS L2 trends are generally positive, consistent with increasing pollutant emissions by fossil energy use and growing industrial and urban activities. It appears that SO2 emission changes dominate the AOD trends, although especially in Asia NOx emissions may become increasingly important. Our results suggest that solar brightening due to decreasing SO2 emissions and the resulting downward AOD trends over Europe may have weakened in the 2000s compared to the 1990s."

abstract = "Recently, temporal changes in Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) have been investigated based on model simulations, satellite and ground-based observations. Most AOT trend studies used monthly or annual arithmetic means that discard details of the generally right-skewed AOT distributions. Potentially, such results can be biased by extreme values (including outliers). This study additionally uses percentiles (i.e., the lowest 5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 95\% of the monthly cumulative distributions fitted to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-observed and ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC)-model simulated AOTs) that are less affected by outliers caused by measurement error, cloud contamination and occasional extreme aerosol events. Since the limited statistical representativeness of monthly percentiles and means can lead to bias, this study adopts the number of observations as a weighting factor, which improves the statistical robustness of trend estimates. By analyzing the aerosol composition of AERONET-observed and EMAC-simulated AOTs in selected regions of interest, we distinguish the dominant aerosol types and investigate the causes of regional AOT trends. The simulated and observed trends are generally consistent with a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.89) and small bias (slope±2σ = 0.75 ± 0.19). A significant decrease in EMAC-decomposed AOTs by water-soluble compounds and black carbon is found over the USA and the EU due to environmental regulation. In particular, a clear reversal in the AERONET AOT trend percentiles is found over the USA, probably related to the AOT diurnal cycle and the frequency of wildfires. In most of the selected regions of interest, EMAC-simulated trends are mainly attributed to the significant changes of the dominant aerosols; e.g., significant decrease in sea salt and water soluble compounds over Central America, increase in dust over Northern Africa and Middle East, and decrease in black carbon and organic carbon over Australia."

abstract = {Abstract The Arctic region is a harbinger of global change and is warming at a rate higher than the global average. While Arctic warming is driven by increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases' in combination with local feedback mechanisms, short-lived climate forcing agents, such as tropospheric aerosol, are also important drivers of Arctic climate. Arctic aerosol-climate impacts vary seasonally as a result of the interplay between aerosol and different cloud types, available solar radiation, sea ice, surface albedo, Arctic and lower latitude removal processes, and atmospheric transport patterns. Photochemistry and efficient wet aerosol removal have low impact in winter but become important in spring to summer, dramatically altering aerosol chemical composition, and driving the size distribution from a pronounced accumulation mode toward a dominance of smaller particles. Retreating sea ice, increasing solar insolation and warmer temperatures in summer result in enhanced emissions from Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and anthropogenic sources, with impacts on the composition of gas and particle phases. Fractional cloud cover reaches a maximum in Arctic summer, in parallel with decreasing sea ice extent and surface albedo. This seasonal variation corresponds to significant changes in the net cloud radiative effect; changes that are affected by aerosol. This review summarizes our current knowledge of processes that control Arctic aerosol properties. We highlight both natural and anthropogenic processes that will be impacted by current and future sea ice loss. Efforts are needed to better constrain aerosol removal rates, characterize aerosol precursors, and constrain the seasonality and magnitude of aerosol-cloud-climate impacts.},
